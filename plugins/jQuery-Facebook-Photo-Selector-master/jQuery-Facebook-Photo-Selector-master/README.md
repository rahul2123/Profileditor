jQuery Facebook Photo Selector
=========================================

[View Demo](http://labs.carsonshold.com/fb-photo-selector/)

This is an interface component that allows you to select a photo from your albums as if you were inside of Facebook. It mimics the 'Change your profile picture' dialogue, but allows you to customize it as you like.

![This is what it looks like.](http://labs.carsonshold.com/fb-photo-selector/demo.png)

This is based on the Friend Selector plugin created by [These Days](http://www.thesedays.com/). Their plugin can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/thesedays/Facebook-friend-selector).

## Viewing the example

You can view the example at [labs.carsonshold.com/fb-photo-selector](http://labs.carsonshold.com/fb-photo-selector/) or you check out this repo and run it yourself.

You'll need to put the files on a web server or virtual host - Facebook apps won't run off the local file system.

Just edit `example.js` and set your Facebook `appId`, then set the 'Website' field in your app settings accordingly.

## Using the plugin

### Include required HTML

- Copy the `div` element with the ID `CSPhotoSelector` (and all of its children) from `index.html`.

### Include required CSS

- Include the `csphotoselector.css` stylesheet in your document.
- Ensure the `csphotoselector` folder is located in the same directory as `csphotoselector.css`. It holds required images.

### Include required JavaScript

- Include jQuery in your document.
- Include the Facebook [JavaScript SDK](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/).
- Include `csphotoselector.js`.

### The fun stuff (using the plugin)

1 - Make sure your user has authenticated your Facebook app. `user_photos` is required. `friends_photos` is required if you would like to browse a friend's photos. These are set in `example.js`.

2 - Initialise the plugin. Here you can set options like toggling debug messages, your preferred classnames, etc.

	CSPhotoSelector.init({debug: true});

3 - Create an instance of the plugin.

	selector = CSPhotoSelector.newInstance({
		callbackAlbumSelected	: callbackAlbumSelected,
		callbackAlbumUnselected	: callbackAlbumUnselected,
		callbackPhotoSelected	: callbackPhotoSelected,
		callbackPhotoUnselected	: callbackPhotoUnselected,
		callbackSubmit			: callbackSubmit,
		maxSelection			: 1,
		albumsPerPage			: 6,
		photosPerPage			: 200,
		autoDeselection			: true
	});

4 - Display the plugin instance when you need it. The plugin will automatically load the Facebook photos of the logged in user, or attempt to load the photos of the friend ID passed to the function.

	$(".photoSelect").click(function (e) {
		e.preventDefault();
		id = null;
		if ( $(this).attr('data-id') ) id = $(this).attr('data-id');
		fbphotoSelect(id);
	});
